            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Their contentious Lecture at Colcheſter, termed your Goſpel Baptiſm, <hi>an infant damning doctrine</hi> and the minſters thereof

               <hi>the Devils Factors</hi> ſtirring up Rulers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, which prebably may prove their ſtrongeſt arguments in oppoſing the Sabbath. As for ſuch (either Presbyterian or any other opinion) who are of a Goſpel frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit free from <hi>Iſhmaelitiſh</hi> perſecuting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, I do not in the leaſt reflect upon them, but highly prize all the lovely appearances of Chriſt in them: knowing that ſuch (though our elder Brethren) dare not murmure at our fathers love, who hath enlightened our minds: with the revived glory of his <hi>Royal Sabbath</hi> but will like noble Bereans weigh this ſerious (and I hope ſober) work in the balance of the ſanctuary.</p>
            <p>If ſuch as would have a precept of this high import ſmothered or concealed, under a bed of ſecurity or Buſhel of plenty were throughly a wakened by the whiſperings of Chriſt; they would readily proclaim this glorious truth upon the houſe top. If this lively oracle of Gods ſeventh day Sabbath be not clearly Inſtituted by the Father, Ratified by the Son, Approved by the ſpirit, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Saints, Let it be confuted and rejected; but if this Royal Law be thus eſtabliſhed, how dreadful must be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued weekly pollution of it after Chriſts call to repentance and reformation? God hath long winked at the dayes of our ignorance
<pb facs="tcp:64807:5"/>but he will not long bear with wilfulneſs. As for you the beloved ſpouſe of Chriſt (Elders, Deacons and Brethren) I do bleſs the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for you; I can never ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that unexpected paſſage of providence that made plain my path unto you; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince God hath ſo eminently crowned my weak (but willing) endeavours among you, we cannot without ingratitude for get the many fatherly favours and conſtant encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements of that worthy inſtrument who firſt invited me to ſerve you.</p>
            <p>The good Lord strengthen us by the choice graces of his precious ſpirit that we may never forfeit our intereſt in this honoured Patriot, or in the leaſt blemiſh our moſt holy profeſſion. Your gracious ſubmiſſion to goſpel truth hath filled my ſoul with joy, and I am ſure God hath enriched your hearts with gifts and grace ſince your ſouls were ſet towards his Sabbath. Tis very much for yoar ſakes (who have earneſtly deſired it) that I have thus far engaged; wherefore with endeared bowels of love I preſent it to you, the good Spirit engrave it in your hearts that you may honour it in your lives, till the Lord of the Sabbath crown all your ſervices and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with everlaſting reſt.

               <p>As to that objection that Chriſt mentions not the Sabbath in his Sermon, and therefore it may be neglected:</p>

That principle which now prompts you to the weekly prophanation of the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath will lead you by inſenſible degrees to as light eſteem of the Lords Supper; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of praying continually, force you from family prayer as a formality. Chriſt delights in his Doves voice, and ſurely our voice is not too good for God, neither it man more ſpiritual then his Maker; he that made us praieth often for us both with heart and voice, and ſo taught us to pray;
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6.</note> and ſo he obſerved Gods ſeventh-day Sabbath both litterally and ſpiritually, and left us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that we ſhould follow his ſteps in all Moral actions.</p>
               <p>Some Sabbath-ſlighters would fain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix a Type to the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but are pitifully puzzled how to bring it to paſs. One would have it a type of our Reſt in Chriſt; but for want of Scripture this conceit is caſhie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſuppoſeth, that the ſacrifices annexed to the <hi>Sabbath</hi> made it typical; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which account every day muſt be typical, ſince ſacrifices were enjoyned every day.</p>
               <p>A third, thinks the <hi>Sabbath</hi> may be a type of Chriſts lying in the grave, but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A fourth confeſſeth, 'tis very difficult to find out this ſuppoſed typicalneſs, and yet adventures to affix the deliverance out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> to the Sabbath, as a type of our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by Chriſt; but every babe in Chriſt at firſt bluſh beholds the very ſame delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance affixed upon the front of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, which manifeſtly proves the Sabbath as free from being typical, as any other part of the Law.</p>
               <p>A fifth (with whom my ſpirit joynes) finding that the Sabbath was never any type of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ledgard Heb.</hi> 4.</note> is perſwaded if it be typical, 'tis onely ſince Chriſt; and that not <hi>Moſes</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> makes it typical of that glorious Reſt-day which ſaints ſhall enjoy with Chriſt a thouſand years, that as the Weekly labour of ſix dayes ends in a Reſt-day of grace, ſo the worlds 6000. years travel ſhall terminate in a Reſt-day in glory.</p>
               <p>Now although I judge that as marriage (ordained in Paradice) is not a type but a ſimilitude of Chriſt, ſo the Sabbath (of the ſame deſcent) doth rather reſemble then type out that Reſt; yet I ſhall not contend, but rather conclude that if the ſeventh day Sabbath be typical of that expected happy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64807:21"/>Reſt, then of neceſſity the type muſt remain until it ſhall be ſwallowed up of the glorious Anti-type.</p>
               <p>A ſixth (in the middeſt of ſuch uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) conceives the Sabbath may be typical of the Goſpel or day of grace.</p>
               <p>But what an abſurdity would this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit put upon our Saviour, as if he ſhould direct his Diſciples to pray,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.20.</note> 
                  <hi>That their ſlight might not be in the Winter nor on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day of grace; i. e.</hi> that they might not flye at all, when as yet he had commanded them to flye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the day of grace be our enjoyned <hi>Sabbath,</hi> then we muſt be ſure as long as the Goſpel laſts to do no ſervile work accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Commandement: but here it's alſo conceived, that the works now prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited are our ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Law did no leſs prohibit ſin then the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This conceit ſuppoſeth God thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding; ſix days (of the Laws duration) thou ſhalt or mayeſt labour and do all thy work of ſin, but the day of grace is the Sabbath, in it thou ſhalt not ſin, thou, thy ſon (and which is extreamly abſurd) thy cattle and the ſtranger that is within thy gates. Either this opinion muſt reject the reſt of the fourth Commandement, as it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64807:22"/>doth the ſeventh day, or elſ it puts it ſelf upon more then an Egiptian task, to keep his ſon, ſervants &amp; ſtrangers from ſin. As for the poor cattle, they are uncapable of ſuch a Reſt as ceſſation from ſin; and the mercileſs Notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt is reaſoning them out of that natural reſt wherewith the merciful God hath priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them: ſo that if there be no reſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but from ſin, the poor bruits may rue the time of Chriſts comming into the world, 'twere well for them that <hi>Peter</hi> had prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to build Tabernacles, that they might have ſtill enjoyed the good dayes of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for Engliſh ſervants, their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be little different from Turkiſh ſlaves, ſo that they might well bewail MES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAH's birth ſhould this opinion prevail, for the boundleſs deſires of earthy-minded Maſters, would ſeldome be weary of the way of getting wealth; neither would their pretended ſpirituality dictate what day to ſpare their wearied ſervants. But inſtead of the Angels good tydings of great joy to all people, ſervants would ſoon cry out ſad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great ſorrow, to be thus deprived of the happy reſt for ſoul and body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to toil and travel on the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Thus by <hi>Origens</hi> allegorical Divinity, (making ceſſation from ſin the onely Goſpel
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64807:22"/>Sabbath) the letter of Gods Law (which cals for corporal reſt and ſpiritual ſervice) is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, Chriſts Sermon abuſed,

               <p>Ceaſe from thy ſhallow conceits thou deluded ſlighter of holy Sabbaths.

               <p>Thus having through Divine aid vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> morality from thoſe inventions and aſperſions raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; I ſhall now proceed to the ſecond part in the Poſition.</p>

               <p>But it may eaſily bee underſtood, that when the ſame power who placed the Sun in its Sphere, ſtayed its courſe one day, and commanded it to return backwards another, this did only lengthen thoſe individual days, and then returned to its natural motion, but altered not the next day at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>And the whole world (though different in Religion) will give full teſtimony that

               <p>And yet what a deal of duſt hath been raiſed from the Prelates aſhes by an old Profeſſour of New England-way againſt their principles, and his own conſcience; his great Argument (borrowed from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops) is this:</p>

               <p>Having thus by Sun-beams, and Scripture ſtreams, reſcued the certainty of the ſeventh day from the clouds of obſcurity; it will be time with all humility to enquire at the gate of Grace, Whether this ſeventh day be the unaltered ſolemn ſeaſon for holy ſervice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel?</p>

<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17.</note> then the ſeventh day Sabbath is that certain deſigned ſeaſon which God will own as a good work in ſuch as obſerve it.

               <p>And as for ſuch as ſuppoſe A ſeventh day or A ſeventh part of time is the morality of the fourth Commandement, they will never help themſelves by it, for if it be a ſeventh day, then it cannot be A ſixth day, or an eighth day, or any other, but ſimply A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, unleſs they will deſtroy their own morality; and ſo for the other notion of a ſeventh part of time, which they confeſs is purely moral, if ſo, then no other time but ſimply the ſeventh part, muſt from week to week be devoted to Gods worſhip through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ages, for whenſoever the ſeventh part

               <p>But by ſuch vain jangling, it ſeems they had rather have any Sabbath, or no Sabbath then the true ſanctified Sabbath, which God hath eſpecially deſigned, and whereon the choiceſt bleſſings may be in faith expected.

               <p> And thus ſhall we take up the ſtumbling blocks, obſtructing their return who can neither brook Babels abominations in the breach of Gods ſecond Royal Law, nor Proteſtants weekly prophanation of the Sabbath with deep diſobediance to the fourth Commandement. Which is moſt dreadfull in ſuch as continue ſabbath-breakers, for earthly advantage, after ſome light of Gods Law hath broken in upon their ſouls (at leaſt) to ſuſpect that it may be Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. So that they have nothing to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and yet (through the worlds ſnares and love of relations) dare continue to act againſt it, wallowing Weeke after Weeke in Sabbath pollutions, till the juſt judgement of GOD at laſt leave them (through cuſtome of ſin) to a ſcared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>odium</hi> caſt upon the ſeventh day Sabbath, by <hi>Gallio</hi> like indifferents and luke-warm <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> is; that 'tis but a circumſtance of time: But the wiſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Preacher doth ſpeedily confute their folly, in a ſentence worthy our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. <hi>Who ſo keepeth the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall feel no evil thing, and a wiſe mans heart diſcerneth both</hi> TIME <hi>and judgement, Eccl.</hi> 3.5.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64807:32"/>and judge themſelves ſo wiſe as to contemn that TIME which God hath ordained to make men wiſer, we ſhall leave to that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is meer fooliſhneſs with God,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19.</note> even to trifle with that precious time which weekly conveys precious plants into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and ſpecial preſence of their Prince.</p>
               <p>But whereas 'tis objected. That holy time and holy place were both of like force: Let ſuch ſhew us the leaſt ſyllable in Gods mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law enjoyning holy place,

               <p>Thus theſe devices fail, as not able to foyl this ſhining ſeaſon, Gods ſanctified ſeventh day Sabbath, which ſtands with ſtrength in Goſpel times: Let our next buſineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be, to know when to enter upon this holy reſt; for it cannot be conceived, that God, who hath been ſo punctual in preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the preciſe time of Circumciſion, the Paſſeover, Penticoſt, and other ceremonies, ſhould leave us to our liberty for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his holy Sabbath.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64807:32"/>being not able to find when to begin their ſuppoſed Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Some affirming it beins in the morning when the Lord aroſe, but what hour they are not able to ſay, ſince God hath purpoſely concealed Chriſts riſing, as he did <hi>Moſes</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial place, to prevent our ſin; ſo that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to begin their Sabbath at break of day, or Sun-riſing, they are uncertain, and know not what to do.</p>

               <p>A third ſort are content to obſerve their Sabbath by halves, and having twenty four hours to their own days. they ſhut up their Sabbath with one half, and ſay an artificial day of twelve hours is ſufficient.</p>

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deu.</hi> 16.6.</note> that from Even to Even (or from Sun to Sun) the Sabbath is to be celebrated. Thus the Jews conſtantly obſerve it, and thus all faithfull Chriſtians ought to ſanctifie it, who by ſcripture authority are thus ſet free from all that confuſion and contention which (as a ſcourge from God) porplexeth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of the ſuppoſed firſt day Sabbath, who
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64807:35"/>know not when to begin, nor when to make an end.</p>
               <p>But here it will be objected, That upon this account the firſt day rauſt be utterly diſcarded ſince the 4th. Commandment as wel requires ſix days ſervice, as the 7th. days Sabbath.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, 1. That whereas the Lord doth expreſly require ceſſation from work on the Sabbath day, he doth not (by a negative) require that we never ceaſe from work upon any of the ſix days; for then we muſt never feaſt, nor faſt, nor uſe any kind of recreation throughout the week.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Hebrew tenſe hath a various aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,

                  </note> yet it is rather future then imperative, and may well enough point out the creatures earthy inclinations, thus. <hi>Six days thou wilt (or ſhalt) labour,</hi> or as it is rendred elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>ſix days may work be done.</hi> God gives us leave to ſerve our ſelves ſix days,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exo.</hi> 31.15.</note> that we may not murmur or repine in devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſeventh wholly to his ſervice: but he is no Aegyptian Task-maſter, to bind us to ſix days inceſſant labour; for then <hi>Paul</hi> ſinned in ſuch a charge, <hi>to preach in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon;</hi> and God himſelfe ſhould croſs his own Command, in requiring <hi>Iſrael</hi> to obſerve the Paſſeover, Penticoſt, Feaſt of Tabernacles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> taking up as many days as the year hath weeks; which ceremonial
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64807:35"/>days Chriſt hath aboliſhed; and therefore we ſhould not grudge to give unto God eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt day, as an addition to the Sabbath, with thankfulneſs for our double benefit, Creation, and Redemption, eſpecially if both days be anthorized by the word of truth.</p>
               <p>As for the ſcriptures quoted in the New Teſtament for the change of the ſeventh day Sabbath, to the firſt day of the week, I ſhall demonſtrate in due time, that not any one of them, nor all together, can make up an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſatisfie a truly enlightened ſoul. But that the Reſurrection day is deſigned for a rejoycing day to Chriſts Diſciples, ſeems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable by the Pſalmiſts ſaying,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 118.24.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and be glad in it.</hi> Which being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Peters</hi> ſpeech
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 4.10, 11.</note>, muſt needs be meant the Reſurrection day.</p>
               <p>And whereas ſome (who are loath to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Gods preſence too often) do ſuppoſe this rejoycing day to be onely Eaſter day, once in a year; I ſhal forbear to anſwer them til they can better agree about the celebration of their traditional Eaſter, and excite Gods people to rejoice and be glad on the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction day as oft as the week brings it about.</p>
               <p>But is this impoſſible to be done unleſs we reject Gods ancient 7th. day Sabbath? why may not the Sabbath ſtand with the firſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64807:36"/>day amongſt Chriſtians as it ſtood with ſo many holy days amongſt the Jews, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince the mercy of a free Redeemer is added to the bleſſings of a bountifull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. 'Tis ſad to ſee perſons ſpend more time in ſin to ſatisfie their luſts, then Profeſtors can part with to ſerve the Lord.</p>
               <p>Welf it ſeems to be Scriptural that the Lord made the Reſurrection day a rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oing day, but he never made it a Sabbath day; and if it be allowed that honourable title of the Lords Day,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.</note> yet doth it no more caſhier the ſeventh day Sabbath then did the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Feaſts, called Sabbaths of old.</p>
               <p>Thoſe many Jewiſh holy dayes (honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the title of Sabbaths, did not then weaken the Royal Sabbath, nor can the ſuppoſed title given to the firſt week-day now do it, ſeeing Chriſt hath for ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed each point and parcel of the Moral Law.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.8 10, 11.</note> Both days may lovingly live amongſt Chriſtians, redeemed from the earth. And though many would be accounted Saints that think they ſhould be undone in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet the ſpotleſs Spouſe of Chriſt, whiles arayed in thoſe royal robes of Sun-like Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64807:36"/>ſhe conſtantly obſerved both theſe dayes, in honour of her Creator and Redeemer, till the little Horn changed her Times and Laws.</p>
               <p>This is ſo generally confeſſed even by the adverſaries of the ſeventh day Sabbath, that other proof would be needleſs in this place. It cannot be denied that the primitive ſaints did honour the Reſurrection day with the honourable title of their Lord; ſo that it became a proverbial queſtion in their greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Servaſti Dominicum?</hi> haſt thou kept the Lords day? to which the other would anſwer, <hi>Christian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>This I conceive is a ſecond ground for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the firſt day, and although the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> with the Councel of <hi>Laodicea</hi> do not any way concern us in this point,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 10.10.3. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.27. <hi>Est.</hi> 9.20</note> yet the ſtatutes enacted by a juſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for the obſervation of daies ſhould be obſerved, provided that ſuch decrees be no way deſtructive to the Sabbath of the Lord our God. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.2, 3.</p>
               <p>This I offer as a third ground of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing on the Reſurrection day, commonly called the Lords day, which we ſhould more readily embrace then any Lecture day. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good old Chriſtian cuſtom of Saints; and it may be fitly termed the Lords
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64807:37"/>day,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6.</note> when with delight we obſerve it to the Lord.</p>
               <p>Reaſons for obſerving both daies are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſtians have more engagements upon them then ever ancient Iſrael had, to devote as much of their time to God; ſhall the greatneſs of his graces ſtraighten us in the advancement of his glory?</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have as frequent neceſſity of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſupplies as they had; why ſhould we be ſeldomer at the throne of grace?</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are ſet free from thoſe great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and bondages, long journeys and vaſt expences, ſacrifices and ceremonies, under which they groaned; and are two daies in ſeven ſuch a task? Is our fathers preſence and ſaints fellowſhip ſo itkſome? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs 'tis ſo to droſſie Diſciples, whoſe love extends no further then the Leaves: why, we are invited into the holy of holies, to make ſure work of eternal manſions, to bear up Gods ſtandard and honour in the world for a little ſeaſon; and are two daies for God and our ſouls ſo tedious and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, when we have more then twice two for our periſhing bodies? we ſhould not be weary to approach the preſence of an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Prince ſo often, for wealth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:64807:37"/> 4. The higheſt pretender to ſpirituality had need enough to get often into Gods Courts and Saints company, to ſhake off his earthy ſhackles, the durty face of our earthly Mother too frequently dulls our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to our heavenly Father: we have little cauſe to couzen our conſciences with with a device to honour God by diſobeying him in ſlighting his precepts, under pretence of ſpiritual performances, as if frequent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance at heavens gates could hinder our ſpiritual growth, or Gods Sabbath ſuppreſs one ſanctity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We are marvailouſly delivered from all thoſe Maſs daies upheld by the Beaſt and his image, to which Saints were compelled by Parators, as Candle Maſs, Chriſt-Maſs, <hi>Michael</hi>-Maſs, and I know not how many Maſtes; and is it now ſuch a matter (with the Sabbath day) to devote the firſt day of the week to Gods worſhip as Saints have done? I fear ſuch Profeſſors did never count the coſt before they took up Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and therefore they fail in that meaſure of ſelf-denial which the Sabbath calls for, which I confeſs is more then all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; but let ſuch know, they will find it as hard for fleſh and bloud to inherit the Kingdome of God, as now they feel the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of Gods Sabbath, and the Lords

               <p>Thus while the ſaints are acted by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits operation, the ſeventh day Sabbath is crowned with the higheſt approbation, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands this day were convinced, converted, baptized, incorporated, and with tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant joys tranſported, feeding like Lambs in freſh paſtures, cloſing this bleſſed ſeventh day Sabbath with the incomparable feaſt of the Lords Supper, and ſacramental union in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one entire body by breaking of bread.

               </p>
               <p>Here's a general injunction, which muſt be obſerved only with theſe limitations, That <hi>Pauls</hi> practiſe be <hi>plain, poſſible, peaceable, Evaugelical, and unrepealed,</hi> or elſe it binds not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be plain, ſuch as our Lord hath promiſed to his Lambs;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.25, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8.</note> We muſt take heed of Philoſophy and vain deceits of men, who ſet up Ordinances by conſequences; and have ſome plain precept or preſident for our practice; and ſuch is the ſeventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. There's not a plainer precept in all the ſcripture, not any thing more plain then <hi>Pauls</hi> practice herein, and therefore to be obſerved by ſaints who deſire the preſence of the God of peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt be poſſible; for ſome things <hi>Paul</hi> practiſed impoſſible for ſaints, as migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miracles, travels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But for the ſeventh
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64807:53"/>day Sabbath, though fleſh and bloud think it a bondage to be detained a day from the Dunghil, yet to the ſelf denying Saint 'tis a moſt pleaſant ſeaſon, and his ſoul can ſeal to it as an eaſie yoke, a light burthen, a day exceeding a thouſand, therefore in this <hi>Paul</hi> is to be followed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His practiſe muſt be peaceable, if we tread in his ſteps, for <hi>Paul</hi> was but a man,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39.</note> and ſometimes a very angry man, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept may poſſibly exceed his practiſe herein; <hi>If it be poſsible, as much as in you lieth, live peaceably with all men:</hi>

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18.</note> and let the peace of God rule in your hearts. Now the ſeventh day Sabbath is a day of reſt and peace, which ſweetly calms the perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit; ſo that thus far wee may freely follow <hi>Pauls</hi> practiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It muſt be Evangelical, for we may not follow <hi>Paul</hi> in his compliance with the Jews in ceremonials, no <hi>not to gain the Jews;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.20.</note> and therefore let <hi>Paul</hi> paſs into the Temple to purifie himſelf with his Votaries, this is no preſident for me. But for the ſacred ſeventh day Sabbath, as it was inſtituted before any ceremonie was in the world, for was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Evangelically by the Son of God, and by his holy Spirit; and therefore in this Evangelical duty I ſhall attend <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:64807:54"/> 5. It muſt be unrepealed, if it oblige Saints, for ſomething <hi>Paul</hi> did which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after repealed,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3.</note> as the Circumciſion of <hi>Timothy,</hi> which he ſolemnly declares to be utterly deſtructive to Chriſtianity; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore waving that, let Chriſtians conform to the Apoſtles practiſe of the ſeventh day Sabbath. which is proved to be <hi>plain, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, peaceable, truly Evangelical, and never in the least tittle repealed, or any way altered.</hi> And thus doing, we ſhall follow <hi>Paul</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> followed Chriſt.

                  <hi>Chriſts custome,</hi> and <hi>Pauls manner. Christ as his cuſtome was went went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, Luk.</hi> 4.16. And <hi>Paul</hi> as his <hi>manner</hi> was did the ſame thing, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.2. Chriſt preached, and <hi>Paul</hi> preached, and where lies the difference between Chriſts obſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſeventh day Sabbath, and <hi>Pauls</hi> obſervation of the ſeventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
               <p>It is made a great argument for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64807:54"/>of the firſt day,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7.</note> That <hi>Paul</hi> once preached on that day, but it is as clearly declared (<hi>Acts.</hi> 18.4.) that <hi>Paul</hi> preached every Sabbath day, onely the Tranſlators have not dealt ſo clearly; for in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. they tell us that <hi>Paul</hi> preached on the firſt day, but in <hi>Acts</hi> 18.4. they ſay <hi>Paul</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned every Sabbath day, and yet the Greek word is the very ſame in both places.</p>
               <p>Neither was this <hi>Pauls</hi> ſingle practiſe, But the conſtant cuſtome of all the Diſciples that ever accompanied him, we finde one companie with <hi>Paul Acts</hi> 13.13, 14. who ſolemnly obſerved the Sabbath in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Other aſsociates he ſelects <hi>Acts</hi> 15.40. and theſe celebrate the Sabbath <hi>Acts</hi> 16.13, 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Thus we may follow <hi>Paul</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions from place to place, and conſtantly find them obſerving the ſeventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: And though he ſolemnly profeſſed, <hi>He had not ſhunned to declare the whole counſel of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20.</note> yet this great ſlighter of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies never gives the leaſt hint of a change, which undoubtedly he would have done, had it been any way altered: Nay, he ſtrictly requires all beleevers to follow his example as he followed Chriſts; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, in the obſervation of the Sabbath, he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64807:55"/>followed Chriſt as cloſe as in any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance whatſoever.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Here obſerve, how this bleſſed Miniſter of Chriſt ſeconds the Apoſtle in labouring to reform that great diſorder amongſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, who came as they liſted to the Lords Supper, ſome ſooner, ſome later, whence ſprang that confuſion, tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wofull deſolation amongſt them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20, 21, 29, 30.</p>
               <p>Wherfore he informs them and us that our oblations (or ſacrifices of praiſe) are not to be performed at our liberty, but that the Lord himſelf hath ordered and appointed ſet times and hours, which undoubtedly is the ſum of the Apoſtles mighty charge to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, That he ſhould be inſtant in preaching in ſeaſon out of ſeaſon.</hi> And the holy <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> aſſures us, that in obſerving the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeaſons we ſhall be accounted bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Now what theſe appointed ſeaſons and time are, that this great God hath ordered his Saints ſhould obſerve; the ſame elect veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel declares in theſe words;

                  <hi>You must keep holy the Sabbath in memory of the Creation, and the Lords day in memory of Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> Certainly this ancient Diſciple of <hi>Paul</hi> did clearly underſtand theſe daies to be ordered and appointed of the Lord; and

Another famous Diſciple of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and holy Martyr of Jeſus, even that heavenly <hi>Ignatius</hi> teacheth the very ſame doctrine in this Dialect; <hi>Next after the Sabbath day, let every friend of Christ make the Lords day a ſolemn Feſtival.</hi> And the ſame holy man <hi>(ad Philip)</hi> ſhews his his deteſtation of Sabbath pollution ſaying. <hi>If any one ſhall keep a faſt on the Lords day or on the Sabbath day,

And if it be as they ſay that Chriſt did not any way diſſolve, but much ſtrengthen this obligation in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, then it is impoſſible to prove any kind of alteration; yet</p>
               <p>Further, If God by a poſitive morall and perpetuall commandement doth binde all men; in all ages to ſuch a particular ſeventh day as himſelfe appointed, then either they muſt prove that God hath made his morall Law mutable by appointing ſome other day, or elſe the ſeventh day Sabbath muſt be reſtored to its primitive glory. Their firſt ground for change of the Sahbath to the firſt day is raiſed from Chriſts reſurrect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and apparition to his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>But the very great difference between
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64807:65"/>the fathers example at the worlds creation, and the Sons action at his reſurrection will ſoone diſcover the vanity of this argument. For upon the Creation of the world, God did ſolemnly ſanctiſie the ſeventh day for his Sabbath and reſted on it, giving as an example for the ground of our obedience, but upon the reſurrection there's not the leaſt ſyllable of a change, inſtitution ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or celebration; yea ſo farre was Chriſt from reſting upon his reſurrection day, that be travelled 15 Miles upon this ſuppoſed New-Sabbath, and this not to any Church-meeting but from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (the place where moſt of his Diſciples were) purpoſely joyning with the two Diſciples that were journeing on foot (7 miles and a halfe) into the Countrey.

               </p>
               <p>Why Chriſtians awake in the name of the Lord, and polute your ſoules no longer with weekly prophanation upon ſuch a ſalf ſuppoſition of a change at Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection you ſee your Creator ſanctified his ſeventh day, Sabbath and ſolemnly reſted upon it, but for the reſutrection day, you have not one word of a command to keep it as a ſabbath, and for an example, you have indeed a lively one, in your Saviours refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to appeare all that day to his Diſciples,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64807:65"/>at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and travelling with two (upon their private occaſions) not giving them the leaſt admonition about Sabbath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (which undoubtedly he would have done as freely as in other things had he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that day for his new <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you conſider, whether this be likely, that Chriſt (who was ſaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all his houſe) ſhould intend the firſt day for his <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and yet never leave one word of inſtitution, nor any other pattern but journeying 15 miles.</p>
               <p>And whereas 'tis gloried that our Lord appeared ſeverall firſt dayes to his Diſciples as they were aſſembled. I believe upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ſearch, it will be found but a vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flouriſh, and that he never appeared to any aſſembly, no not any one firſt day. For it is moſt certaine, that the day upon the Scripture account begins (with the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>And now let us obſerve that upon the firſt day,
<note place="margin">Luke 24.29, 30.</note> he aroſe we find him at the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage 7 Miles from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when it was towards evening, and the day far ſpent,
<note place="margin">Luk. 24.29, 30.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he ſupped with the two, which tooke up ſome time; then they returned that, 7 miles and a halfe, to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on foot, So that, if the day were far ſpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64807:66"/>they entred the Village it muſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe be quite ſpent before they could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and eate their ſuppers, and returne 7 miles and a halfe.</p>
               <p>And ſo before Chriſt appeared to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven,
<note place="margin">Luk. 24.22. John 20.19.</note> the firſt day muſt needs be done, and whereas 'tis ſaid, he appeared the firſt day at evening yet you muſt know, that the firſt day was then as fully ended, as it is plaine the ſabbath
<note n="*" place="margin">Mar. 1.32.</note> was ended at evening, when the Sun did ſet, and the people brought their ſick to be healed, which they were forbidden to doe on the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>As for Chriſts ſecond appearing to the aſſembled Diſciples,
<note place="margin">John 20.26.</note> it's expreſly ſaid, it was after eight dayes, and therefore could not be on the firſt day of the Week.</p>
               <p>And for his third apparition,
<note place="margin">John 21.</note> ſurely they will not ſay, 'twas on the firſt day, ſeeing they were at their trade.</p>
               <p>But indeed the Lord was ſeene of ſome,
<note place="margin">Acts 1.2.3.</note> or other of them, fourty dayes, never <hi>being</hi> idle all the time,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.6.</note> ſo that his apparations prove not any thing as to a change of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a conceit that the cauſe of the Diſciples aſſembling on the firſt day was to celebrate the new Sabbath, in honour of Chriſts reſurrection; when as they were ſo
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64807:66"/>far from believing Chriſt was riſen, that the womens tydings there of,

But here 'tis evident how ſadly they are put to it, that muſt ſay ſomething for their firſt day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath and yet can ſay no better.</p>
               <p>For although they would make ſome ſhew of Scripture, yet all amounts to a bare endeavour to draw ſome ſupport for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warantable <hi>Sabbath</hi> from any Text that doth but mention the firſt day of the Week

               <p>Now if the firſt day had been a Sabbath, ſurely,

               <p>Why ſhould he have this done on the firſt day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It hath been clearly ſhewed, that <hi>Pauls</hi> conſtant practice was, to preach on the ſeventh day, Sabbath, and that it was the exact examplar,

So that, if we can believe they walked in <hi>Pauls</hi> conſtant Practice in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true <hi>Sabbath,</hi> we may eaſily judge that <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle was read in the Church at their ſolemne aſſembly, on the Sabbath day, and we may not doubt that the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers would ſtir up the people to liberallity, upon the Apoſtles order, and the rather ſeeing he cloſed his Epiſtle with it, that it might ſit cloſe and warm upon their hearts, and for as much as they were not like to be

               <p>Thus with very good reaſon did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle make choice of the firſt day, for this duty.</p>
               <p>But to aſſert the firſt day to be a Sabbath, becauſe the Apoſtle ordered every man by himſelfe to lay up ſomething for the poore Saints there being not the leaſt mention of a Church-meeting that day (and yet I ſay) to aſſert that day for a <hi>Sabbath</hi>) is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether irrationall and utterly unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p> The third Scripture abuſed about the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed change of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> only ſpeaks thus much, That <hi>John was in the spirit on the Lords day,</hi> but that this was any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall day is uncertain,

               </p>
               <p>But if the Scripture may be our guide, it will inform us, but of two dayes honoured as the Lords dayes.</p>
               <p>And the firſt is the antient ſanctified ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day <hi>Sabbath</hi> royally dignified with that title of the Sabbath of THE LORD OUR GOD,

                  <hi>The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> and no other day declares he to be his throughout the Goſpel. So that, the ſeventh day Sabbath, and only that (as an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall and ſingle day) is honoured with this

               <p>But I rather think he ſpake of that other Lords day owned in Scripture as the Lords judgment day,
<note place="margin">Mal. 14. Luke. 17. Phil. 1.16.10.</note> and this the Lord himſelfe calls his day, and this day was moſt clearly ſhewed unto <hi>John</hi> in many glorious viſions, and in the Spirit he was in this day for ſo runs the Greeke, I was in the Spirit, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>The neglect of this morall reſt was wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin: for which the Lord deſtroyed them in the Wilderneſſe, as is plain Ezek. 20.13. and this being compared with the Apoſtles, Admonition to the Chriſtians, <hi>plainly points out the Sabbath that remains to the people of God.</hi> He ſets forth <hi>Iſraels</hi> fin and <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſorrow, on this wiſe.

               </p>
               <p>And here we have conſiderable, firſt, the continued duty, that is <hi>The celebration of the Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Firſt as to the remaining duty, the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating of the Sabbath, I need ſay little having already ſhewed that the ſeventh day Sabbath is one of thoſe lively Oracles that <hi>Iſrael received from Sinai to give unto us.</hi> And that our God hath eſpecially comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us (to whom theſe Oracles are given) to REMEMBER his ſeventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to ſanctifie it, and tis our mercy that his holy ſpirit doth here record (what the tranſlators were loath to reveale in eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh) <hi>That there remaineth the keeping of the Sabbath to the people of God.</hi> I know tis ſet downe in the margin of our Bibles the keeping of a Sabbath, whence they would evade the ſeventh day Sabbath, and ſet up a Sabbath of their own (although the Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries, and Lexicons render it plainly the <hi>keeping of the Sabbath.</hi> But let the people of God celebrate the ſeventh day Sabbath untill they can find the holy Spirit calling any other day a Sabbath, and then let them change.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:64807:76"/>
               <p> The ſecond thing is, the perſons exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this duty, and they are believers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into their ſpirituall reſt; and therefore tis moſt irrationall to affirm this remaining Sabbath to be nothing but a ſpirituall reſt into which believers enter, verſe 3. and ſo become the people of God; and as Gods people they are to celebrate the Sabbath; <hi>There remaineth therefore the celebration of the Sabbath to</hi> (thoſe that are already) <hi>the people of God.</hi> And I hope ſuch as are the people of God will remember to obſerve it as being under a double obligation. I Gods inſtitution, and obſervation, making himſelfe our preſident of which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken. 2. Chriſts ceſſation from his great works, and entring thereupon into his reſt; and this is laid down as the Goſpel reaſon why the Sabbath remaines to the people of God. <hi>For he that is entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his reſt, he alſo hath ceaſed from his works, as God did from his owne works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some conceive, That believers are here ſaid to enter into reſt; but then it would be needleſs to excite them to enter in the verſe following, It is Chriſt only
<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 4.12</note> whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into reſt is here intended, who ceaſed from his works as God did from his; <hi>and therefore there remaineth che celebration of

               </p>
               <p>Here then the myſterious payment of mans Ranſome is matter of high admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being the ſame day that man was made, and that very day, and time of the day whereon God finiſhed the glorious work of creation: and ſo ceaſing from his labours, our Saviour exactly entered into his reſt that very day and time as God began his reſt; povidentially ordering his body to be taken down, and laid to reſt in his Sepulchre in the Cloſe of the ſixth day, that no part of his Sabbath ſhould be violated; and thus ceaſing from his works as God did, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into his Reſt exactly as God did; it laies believers under a double engagement to ſanctifie the ſeventh day Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father, i.e.</hi> As the Father engageth us to honour him in celebrating the ſabbath becauſe he reſted on it from the works of Creation.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64807:78"/>remaines to the people of God.

But ſince the ſeventh day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is undoubtedly one of thoſe lively oracles which <hi>Iſrael</hi> received from <hi>Sina</hi> to give unto us; O Chriſtians embrace it, love it, lay it in your boſomes it: in vites and will conduct you weekly into the Princes preſence, where it will open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you all the reſt of thoſe lively oracles and divine myſteries that are coupled with it, while ſuch as ſlight and reject this heavenly law and ſtill aſſert a chang without book, ſhall run themſelves upon many dangerous rocks and ſands which tender hearts ſhould tremble at.</p>
               <p>As firſt they muſt affront the holy ſpirit, who was moſt punctual in ſundry ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for the ſolemn repeal and abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of circumciſion, and all thoſe typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sabbaths which were againſt us and contrary to us, ſhaddowing good things to come with the viſible burial of the whole body of the ceremonial law, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64807:81"/>yet this bleſſed ſpirit (purpoſely appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to lead us into all truth) was ſo far from repealing the ſeventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that he conſtantly calls that (and none other) the Sabbath day, that is, the Lords holy reſt-day, and pours down his graces in moſt abundant meaſure that day.</p>
               <p>So that if the ſabbath day be altered, Gods holy ſpirit cannot eſcape an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front for concealing the change from us. Certainly there is need of a clear word for the change, or repeal of ſuch a royall Law, and lively oracle.</p>

               <p>He manifeſtly declared the nullity of all ceremonial Laws, but as for this lively Oracle (with the reſt) he termed it a holy,

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64807:81"/>terms that there remaineth the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the ſabbath to the people of God, and not only ſo, but having laid ſuch a high charge upon all Chriſtian Miniſters * to be inſtant in Preaching,
<note place="margin">Compare 2 Tim. 4.1, 2. with chap. 2.2.</note> in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, he plainly ſhews by his conſtant practice in Preaching eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſabbath day both among Jews &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles this which is the very Goſpel ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Preaching, wherein he followes Chriſt &amp; binds believers to follow him.</p>
               <p>So that if it be true as ſabbath changers ſay, where can we find a more diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling perſon then the Apoſtle <hi>Paul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither do they reſt here, but even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Chriſt himſelf who is ſaid to be faithful in all his houſe, even as <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful in his houſe. Now we know that <hi>Moſes</hi> hath moſt expreſſy ſet down from time to time the very ſolemn ſeaſon wherein his houſe ſhould aſſemble and worſhip God. But of the ſabbaths change, Chriſt never ſpake one word to his houſe, nay on the contrary he declared, that as long as Heaven and earth laſted his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples muſt not break one jot or title of thoſe lively oracles that <hi>Iſrael</hi> received from <hi>Sinai</hi> to give unto us, yea in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular he owned the ſeventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64807:82"/>as his Sabbath, and ſo left it under his hand, and ſealed it by his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous miracles, and with tender fatherly care required his houſe to pray that they might not be forced to flee upon it ſortie years after his death.</p>
               <p>And as for the day which ſabbath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers accept, and aſſert for their Sabbath, he never gave them one ſyllable of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and for his preſident it hath plainly appeared, that he journeyed freely fifteen miles upon it. So that if the Sabbath be changed, Chriſt is far enough from <hi>Moſes</hi> faithfulneſs in all his houſe; But further how dreadful is it to father that change of the Sabbath upon the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Son of God,
<note place="margin">Dan. 7.25.</note> which is the deteſtable deſign of the little horn. The changer of times and Lawes what! charge that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt which is the proper preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Antichriſt! is not this the whores mark, to change the Saints times? the Saints Sabbath time, and the Saints ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time.

               <p>Chriſt cals for believers and they bring him infants, Chriſt cals for made diſciples and they bring him ſucking children, Chriſt commands to teach them firſt and baptize them after, and they ſprinkle them firſt and promiſe to teach them to be diſciples after whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will learn or not! So Chriſt cals for the ſeventh day Sabbath to be celebrated by the people of God, &amp; they weekly pollute the ſeventh day and put him off to the eighth,

But that perſons may for ever dread ſuch indifferency and impiety in putting off the Almighty from a ſeventh to an eighth, I ſhall preſent you with the horrible preſumption of that unparallel'd Jewiſh Antichriſt <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> whoſe ten revolted Tribes did as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably reſemble the ten horns of the Romiſh Antichriſt, as his change of the ſeventh moneth of Gods appointment

This wicked <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had not onely changed Gods Ceremonial Lawes but he further preſumed to change the Ceremonial time of the feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles;
<note place="margin">Lev. 23.33.34. 1 Kin. 12 32.33.</note> for whereas God commanded <hi>Iſrael</hi> to keep the fifteenth day of the ſeventh moneth, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ordained the fifteenth day of the eight month, and ſee how God records this in his book of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. And <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ordained a feaſt in the eight moneth on the fifteenth day of the moneth like unto the feaſt that is in <hi>Judah</hi>—ſo he offered upon—the fifteenth day of the eighth moneth even in the moneth which he had deviſed of his own heart.</p>

               <p>And as for ſundry hypocrites, who masked and marched in profeſſion, as far as their gifts would carry them, The Lord hath notably unhooded them by this glorious truth; ſo that the Sabbath being too hot for them, Satan hath drawn them from the worſhip of the Lord, to wallow again in the world; neer upon twenty perſons hath the enemy thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared, out of two hundred and fifty.
